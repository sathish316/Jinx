Jinx is a javascript MVC framework with a dsl for writing restful ajax applications. 
It lets you separate and easily manage your javscript code into the model, view and controller pattern.

Jinx is not pure MVC. It is loosely based on the MVP pattern and has the following principles:
* View encapsulates the DOM view on the HTML page.
View captures DOM events and translates them as application events to the controller.
View only takes care of rendering sections of a page and doesn't have any application logic.
* Model is a representation of your Server side models on the browser.
Models know how to make RESTful calls so you dont have to write any code if you want to perform CRUD operations on the model.
* Controller is responsible for binding the model and view together and for communicating with other controllers.

Jinx uses a dsl to simplify 
- DOM event translation in View to app events on the controller
- chaining ajax callback actions in the controller

There is an example todolist rails app which drives development.
Jinx is still under development.
