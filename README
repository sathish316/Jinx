Jinx is an MVC helper for javascript written in jquery. It lets you segregate and easily manage your monolithic javscript code into
the model, view and controller pattern, which is the cornerstone of GUI apps.

Jinx is not pure MVC. It is loosely based on the MVP pattern and has the following principles:
* View encapsulates the DOM view on the HTML page.
View captures DOM events and translates them as application events to the controller.
Jinx uses a dsl to simplify DOM event translation to app events and encourages to use that as much as possible.
The View by itself doesn't contain any application logic other than rendering sections of a page.
* Model is a representation of your Server side models on the client side.
Models know how to make REST calls so you dont have to write any code if you want to perform CRUD operations on the model.
* Controller is responsible for binding the model and view together and for communicating with other controllers.
Controller can make Ajax calls which are not related to a domain model
* It comes with generators for model, view and controller similar to rails
* It has testing support using blueridge built in, with helpers for easily accessing model, view and controller in tests.

Please read through the sample application code to know how you can use Jinx to leverage classic MVC patterns to write better ajax applications.
